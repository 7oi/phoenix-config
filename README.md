# Phoenix configuration

This is my personal [Phoenix](kasper/phoenix) configuration, written in TypeScript. I also created [typings](https://github.com/mafredri/phoenix-typings) for it, feel free to use them.

## Basic key bindings

* `hyper + Left` (Left half of screen)
* `hyper + Right` (Right half of screen)
* `hyper + Up` (Top half of screen, keeps current width)
* `hyper + Down` (Bottom half of screen, keeps current width)
* `hyper + Enter` (Toggle maximize)
* `hyper + Tab` (Jump to next screen)
